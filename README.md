# FanficNewApplicationASP

My first ASP.NET project when I was studying in *Itransition* courses. This is a fanfic library site with many relationships between tables in database (MSQL Server)

This project contains authorization system and admin panel, where admin can block, unblock, delete users, make them admins.

This project uses C# ASP.NET, Entity Framework, Identity, Bootstrap, MicrosoftSQL Server.
